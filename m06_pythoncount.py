	# you will see that python is really fast at counting!
	# if you want to slow it down, you'll need to uncomment
	# the next line by removing the leading hashtag
	#time.sleep(0.1)  
	# removing the hashtag may change the indentation of the line
	# make sure the t from time is aligned with the other hashtags 
	# when you're ready to run
